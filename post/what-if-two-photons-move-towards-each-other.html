        <p>
          The idea of photon made the scientist think about it. There is something odd
          about this particular thing. Even Albert Einstein rode photons in his famous
          thought experiments. He imagined how it would be to ride a photon, would time
          be the same for a photon?

          Letâ€™s think about the two photons. Let them move with the velocity of light ($c$).
          Wait, photons ARE light! Ok, letâ€™s move on. Now, letâ€™s think that you are on
          one photon, riding, and me, on the other photon. So, whatâ€™s the velocity between us?
          <br><br>
          Classical mechanically, anyone would say that if two objects move towards each
          other then their relative velocity is the addition of their velocity.

          $$v = v_1 + v_2$$

          Which suggests that our relative velocity is $2c$. But itâ€™s not possible for
          anything to travel faster than the light. In the case of a photon, not only
          photon, anything thatâ€™s moving with a velocity closer to the speed of light,
          doesnâ€™t necessarily obey the laws of classical mechanics.
          <br><br>
          For things that move with the velocity closer to the speed of light, there
          is a relativistic equation for relative velocity (Irony. Relativistic relative
          motion. ðŸ˜€).

          $$v_\text{rel} = \frac{v_1-v_2}{1-\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$$

          Now, if $v_1$ is positive then $v_2$ will be negative due to their directions.
          Now, we plug in their values to the relativistic equation.

          $$v_\text{rel} = \frac{c-(-c)}{1-\frac{c\times(-c)}{c^2}} = c$$

          As we can see that, relative velocity between two photons is equal to their
          own velocity, which is the speed of light.
          <br><br>
          In classical mechanics, the velocity of the object is so less than the
          velocity of light. As a consequence, the ratio $v_1 v_2/c^2$ approaches to
          zero. And we get the classical relative velocity,

          $$v = v_1 + v_2$$

          You might say, wait a minute! It should be $v_1 - v_2$. Well, you're right.
          We should have been more careful in the first equation and considered velocity
          with direction. The it would've been $\vec{v}_1 - \vec{v}_2$. Sorry about that!
          <br><br>
          Ok. Now, letâ€™s get back to business. So, what happens to the photons if they
          collide? Do they bounce off from each other?
          <br><br>
          However, two photons heading towards each other can indeed collide indirectly.
          The process goes like this. A photon can spontaneously degenerate into a
          particle with mass and its antiparticle in a process known as pair production.
          In this process, the energy of the photon is completely transformed into the
          mass of the two particles. For example, a photon can turn into an electron and
          an anti-electron. If two photons head towards each other and they both turn
          into electron/anti-electron pairs at about the same time, then these particles
          can interact. The anti-electron from one photon will collide with an electron
          from the other photon, and turn back to light. The same thing happens to the
          other anti-electron and electron. The overall effect is that you get two photons
          going into the interaction and you get two photons coming out of the interaction,
          so it looks like the photons simply bounced off each other. In a sense, the one
          bit of light did indeed bounce off the other bit of light, but only indirectly
          by transforming into other particles.
